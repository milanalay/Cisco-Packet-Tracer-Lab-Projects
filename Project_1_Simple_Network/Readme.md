# Design and Implementation of a Simple Networking Project

## Design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connects ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
    - Each department should contain at least two PCs. 
    - Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
    - Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
    - All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
    - Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.

### Technologies Implemented
    - Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.
    - Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
    - Connecting two Networks using a Router.
    - Subnetting and IP Addressing.
    - Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.
    - Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.
    - Test and Verifying Network Communication.



Notes:
    Network address = 192.168.40.0
    No. of subnets = 2

    2^n = no. of subnets
    i.e. 2^n = 2

    N = 1
    255.255.255.255
    11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000
    255.255.255.128 => subnet mask
